# San-Francisco-Airbnb-data

People travel for work, for pleasure and for some it is just a way of life. San Francisco has a lot to offer to travellers of any kind. The city is known for its diverse culture, fantastic scenery, unusual climate and great food. One basic need for any kind of traveller is accomodation, where he is relaxes while on the tour. These days, many people prefer listings in Airbnb compared to luxurious hotels, either based on their budget or for a family home feel or based on the size of the group. In this work, we are attempting to do an analysis on Airbnb San Francisco data to understand how a traveller makes a decision on his accomodation choice. We would like to look into
- We want to see why some accomodations have high ratings compared to the rest?
- Why are some accomodations occupied more compared to the rest?
- Can we send recommendations to the hosts/owners with less ratings and occupancy for improvement?
- Which locality and what kind of accomodation is a traveller more like to stay at?
- Can we send recommendations to the travellers based on price range, description, location etc
